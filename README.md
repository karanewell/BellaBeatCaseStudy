# INTRODUCTION
Welcome to my Google Capstone Project - Case Study 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

I will be taking on the role of Junior Analyst assigned to the marketing analyst team of BellaBeat for the last six months. The company, Bellabeat, is a high-tech manufacturer of products for women that monitors biometric and lifestyle data to help women better understand how their bodies work and make healthier choices. In a recent meeting with the team, I learned the company has the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. To provide value to the team, and to answer key business questions, I will follow the six steps of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**, **share**, and **act**.

## PHASE ONE: ASK
*Define the problem and confirm stakeholder expectations*
### 2.1 ABOUT THE COMPANY
Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products.
