# INTRODUCTION
Welcome to my Google Capstone Project - Case Study 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

I will be taking on the role of Junior Analyst, working with the marketing analyst team for the company BellaBeat, a high-tech manufacturer of products for women that monitors biometric and lifestyle data to help women better understand how their bodies work and make healthier choices. In meeting with the team, I have learned the company has the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. To provide value to the team, and to answer key business questions, I will follow the six steps of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**, **share**, and **act**.
